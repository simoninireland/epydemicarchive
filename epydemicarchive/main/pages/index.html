<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
  This is the epydemic network archive, a repository of random (and
  other) networks for doing network science.
</p>

<p>
  To download networks from the archive, you can either
  <a href="{{ url_for('archive.browse') }}">browse the entire
  collection</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('archive.search') }}">search
  the archive</a> against tags or criteria such as size, degree
  distribution, and so on. You can also <a href="{{
  url_for('archive.upload') }}">submit</a> networks in a range of
  common file formats. Accessing the archive is unrestricted; to
  upload networks you need to <a href="{{ url_for('auth.register')
  }}">register</a> and then <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}">sign
  in</a>.
</p>

<p>
  However, this manual use of the archive is inconvenient for
  large-scale use. An easier way is to access the archive
  programmatically using its API. If your work makes use of the
  epydemic simulation framework then the archive can be used
  transparently as a source of networks for your simulations, and you
  can also submit networks directly from programs.
