<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
  This is the epydemic archive, a repository of random (and
  other) networks for doing network science.
</p>

<h2>Why does the archive exist?</h2>

<p>
  Network science uses random networks to test how processes behave
  under different conditions, without constraining experiments to a
  single network that might have specific features that affect the
  process. This means that a typical experiment makes use of
  a <i>lot</i> of networks: we might perform an experiment at 100
  points in a parameter space and conduct 100 repetitions at each
  point to get decent averaging. That would require 10,000 random
  networks if we conducted each repetition on its own network; even if
  we're more parsimonious we might still need several hundred networks
  to ensure fairness.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't a problem for small networks and for some topologies:
  Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi networks are cheap to construct, even for
  large orders. But more complex topologies can become expensive to
  generate, and this slows down experiments.
<p>

<p>
  Wouldn't it be useful to be able to pre-create a library of networks
  with different sizes and topologies, and then re-use them from
  simulations? We could then separate the time spent generating
  networks from the time spent using them for experiments. Of course
  we'd have to be careful that we had enough networks to choose from,
  and that we didn't spoil out statistics by accidentally using too
  few different networks.
</p>

<p>
  The epydemic archive performs this task.
</p>

<h2>How do I use the archive?</h2>
<p>
  To download networks from the archive, you can either
  <a href="{{ url_for('archive.browse') }}">browse the entire
  collection</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('archive.search') }}">search
  the archive</a> against tags or criteria such as size, degree
  distribution, and so on. You can also <a href="{{
  url_for('archive.upload') }}">submit</a> networks in a range of
  common file formats. Accessing the archive is unrestricted; to
  upload networks you need to <a href="{{ url_for('auth.register')
  }}">register</a> and then <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}">sign
  in</a>.
</p>

<p>
  However, this manual use of the archive is inconvenient for
  large-scale use. An easier way is to access the archive
  programmatically using its API. If your work makes use of the
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/epydemic/">epydemic</a> simulation
  framework then the archive can be used transparently as a source of
  networks for simulations, and you can also submit networks
  directly from programs.
