Overview
--------

``epydemicarchive`` implements a web application to create and
maintain a collection of complex networks that can be used in epidemic
(and other) network-based simulations. It is intended to allow re-use
of networks that may be computationally expensive to create, and so
support easier and more robust simulations.

``epydemicarchive`` is written entirely in Python and can be hosted by
any WSGI-compliant web server.
